Remarks
-------
This is very much a hobby project - I do a fair amount of sets on the turbo-trainer at home and got a bit sick of trying to program my watch with some of the more complicated ones. This application should (hopefully) make like a lot easier and with the ability to load/save/edit sets, you can even share them out if you have others doing the same set.

This is also very much a work-in-progress, there's a hefty to-do list. Feel free to raise issues for any feature requests, bugs, etc.
